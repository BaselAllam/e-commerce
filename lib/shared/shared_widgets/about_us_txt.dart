Effective Date: [Insert Date]

At Dempi, we strive to provide the best experience for our users. If you decide to cancel your subscription or membership, please review the following cancellation policy.

1. Subscription Cancellation
If you have a paid subscription to Dempi, you may cancel your subscription at any time. The following terms apply to cancellations:

a) How to Cancel
To cancel your subscription, follow these steps:

Open the Dempi app.
Go to "Settings" and select "Account."
Choose the "Manage Subscription" option.
Follow the instructions to cancel your subscription.
Alternatively, you may also cancel through the app store (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play Store) where you initially subscribed.

b) Timing of Cancellation
If you cancel your subscription before the next billing cycle begins, your subscription will continue to be active until the end of your current billing period. You will not be charged again after the current period expires.
If you cancel after the billing cycle has started, you will still have access to your subscription until the end of the current period, but no further charges will be made.
c) Refund Policy
Refunds are generally not offered for partial periods. If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access to the service until the end of the current billing cycle.
30-Day Money-Back Guarantee: If you cancel within the first 30 days of your subscription, you may be eligible for a full refund. To request a refund, please contact our support team at [support@dempi.com].
2. Free Trial Cancellation
If you are on a free trial period for Dempi, you can cancel your free trial at any time before the trial period ends to avoid being charged for a paid subscription.

To cancel your free trial, follow the steps outlined in the "How to Cancel" section above. If you cancel during the free trial, you will not be charged, and your access to premium features will be terminated at the end of the trial period.

3. Account Deletion
If you wish to permanently delete your account, you can do so by contacting our support team at [support@dempi.com]. Please note that deleting your account will result in the loss of all your data and access to the services provided by Dempi. This action is irreversible.

4. Effect of Cancellation
Upon cancellation of your subscription, your access to premium features and content will be revoked at the end of the current billing cycle or free trial. You will retain access to any free features or content available within the app.
